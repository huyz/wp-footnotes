WP-Footnotes
============
This is a fork of Simon Elvery's [WP-Foonotes](http://elvery.net/drzax/wordpress-footnotes-plugin) plugin for WordPress, which does what the name implies.

Some people have requested additional features, so I figured I'd oblige.

This version:

*    Adds support for a [footnotes] shortcode which lets you control where in the content to place the footnotes -- even before the references, if you want.

This repository is kept in sync with the [Subversion repo](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-footnotes/) at the [WordPress.org Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins).
